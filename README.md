Machine learning and data modeling is the area of particular interest to me. In the increasingly digitalized world, machine learning has been emerging in response to the enormous amount of data generated every single day. Machine learning, with its power of facilitating more accurate prediction and inferential tasks, will undoubtedly change the way we traditionally operate. 

This project is going to focus on in-depth research about learning to classify the non-stationary distribution. The research promises to leverage the machine learning algorithms to encourage more accurate prediction on the data stream and have critical influences in various areas where the data is continuously updated such as banking and finance, customer relationship management or government planning. Based on Naive Bayesian classifier (A0DE), averaged one dependence estimator classifier (A1DE) and averaged two dependence estimators classifier (A2DE), this project aims at finding which optimal classifiers and window sizes to classify massive data streams. In this project, the data sample will be taken from MOA (Massive Online Analysis), an open source framework for data stream mining to test machine learning algorithms.
